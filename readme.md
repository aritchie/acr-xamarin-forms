##Xamarin Forms Signature Pad 
=================

###Signature Pad
Android/iOS Control provided by [Xamarin Signature Pad](https://github.com/xamarin/SignaturePad).  
This Library is a Fork of https://github.com/aritchie/acr-xamarin-forms
I am actively adding Windows Runtime support

This library provides a way to call for a dialog from a view model command or
it can be used within your XAML views.
* [XAML Example](https://github.com/aritchie/acr-xamarin-forms/blob/master/Samples/Samples/Views/SignatureXamlView.xaml)
* [ViewModel Example](https://github.com/aritchie/acr-xamarin-forms/blob/master/Samples/Samples/ViewModels/SignatureListViewModel.cs)
